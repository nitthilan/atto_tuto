### General Machine Learning Workflow
- Planning to keep it simple. Any questions and suggestion do drop a comment.
- Any particular areas you want to cover do write it in the comment

- This tutorial would be a hands on development of code for different deep learning models and architectures. I would most probably would be using Pytorch Lightining for development. For the first tutorial lets look at a simple CNN based image classification architecture. 

I would be mostly concentrating on the development workspace and general workflow in this tutorial using the image classification

Machine Learning Workflow
- Prepare the dataset for the problem. We plan to use MNIST
- Decide on a machine learning model or architecture to solve the problem. This would be CNN based architecture.
- Use a proper framework. This would be pytorch-lightning. Since it is simple to integrate and run

Lets look at the above three in detail:

Lets start with a small introduction about CNN: https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~yjlee/teaching/ecs289g-winter2018/CNN_basics.pdf
- https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic/blob/master/README.md


Having chosen the dataset and architecture lets look at the pytorch-lighting framework to understand how we can use the given dataset and architecture to train and validate the machine learning model

With all this knowledge lets now do some coding.


Now the coding is done
